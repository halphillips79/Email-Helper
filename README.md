# Email Helper
An automated email-sending app for a small local business.

## Introduction
Email Helper is a Django-based web application designed to automate the process of sending customized emails based on spreadsheet data. This project was my first foray into coding, done as a learning experience; as such, it may include some beginner-level inconsistencies and/or redundancies. Despite this, though, the project showcases my ability to create a practical, client-driven solution using Google APIs, Python, and Django. The application effectively meets the real-world needs of automating email-related tasks based on various spreadsheet inputs, saving the client time on what had previously been a manual task.

## Functionality
- **Customized Email Automation**: Reads specific text and variables from a Google Sheets spreadsheet to tailor the content, subject, recipients, and CCs of emails (via Gmail).
- **User-Controlled Operation**: Emails are sent by user initiation through a button on a web interface, providing manual control over the automated process.

## Implementation
- **Django Framework**: Developed using the Django web framework.
- **Hosting**: Application is hosted on Python Anywhere for accessibility.
- **Spreadsheet Integration**: Configured to integrate with spreadsheet data for email customization.

## Usage
1. **Access Web Interface**: The application is accessible via a web interface hosted on Python Anywhere.
2. **Prepare Spreadsheet**: Ensure the spreadsheet is properly formatted and accessible to the application.
3. **Send Emails**: Use the button on the web interface to start the email sending process.

## Privacy and Customization
- **Data Privacy**: Replaced client-specific and sensitive data with "PLACEHOLDER" to maintain confidentiality.
- **Adaptable Design**: Flexibility to adapt to various spreadsheet formats and email requirements.

## Note to Prospective Employers
As my inaugural coding project, Email Helper was a significant learning curve and an opportunity to develop practical software solutions. It demonstrates my commitment to solving real-world problems and adapting to the technical challenges encountered along the way. While it includes elements typical of early-career development, it stands as a testament to my growth and dedication in the field of software development.
